## Description
This Shiny app has been developed as part of the Developing Data Products course by John Hopkins University through Coursera.

Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) declare and publish a list of disasters in the United States each year. This publicly available data is very interesting to look at using the created Shiny app.

## Usage
The left panel shows a filter on the Year. Data from 2005 to 2016 has been collected and used in this application. You can use the PLAY button on the Year filter to see an animated view of the disasters in the United States over time. The geographical map highlights the states where the disasters were declared. The color scale is based on the number of disasters in each State - lighter red indicates low number of disasters and darker red indicates higher number of disasters.

An interactive table on the right panel displays details of the disasters as published by FEMA. The data in the table is updated according to the Year filter.
